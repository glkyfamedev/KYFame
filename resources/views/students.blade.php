                            A PROGRAM DESIGNED BY MANUFACTURERS
                        </h3> 
                        <p>The <b>Advanced Manufacturing Technician program (AMT)</b> is a two-year, work-and-learn program that connects manufacturers with high-achieving recent high school graduates. Manufacturers provide the hands-on training, while Jefferson Community & Technical College provides relevant coursework chosen by employers. The combination of on-site technical training and in-class curriculum designed to fit industry needs produces skilled workers ready for today’s advanced manufacturing. After two years, each student earns an applied associate degree in Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 70 to 80 college credit hours and gains two years’ work experience, incurring little to no education debt in the process.</p>
